	    Sub-queries and Nested SELECTs
	    
Execute a working query using a sub-select to retrieve all employees records whose salary is lower than the average salary.

Solution
select EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, SALARY 
from employees 
where SALARY < (select AVG(SALARY) 
                from employees);

Execute a Column Expression that retrieves all employees records with EMP_ID, SALARY and maximum salary as MAX_SALARY in every row.

Solution
select EMP_ID, SALARY, ( select MAX(SALARY) from employees ) AS MAX_SALARY 
from employees;

Execute a Table Expression for the EMPLOYEES table that excludes columns with sensitive employee data (i.e. does not include columns: SSN, B_DATE, SEX, ADDRESS, SALARY).

Solution
select * 
from ( select EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, DEP_ID from employees) AS EMP4ALL;



Exercise 1: Accessing Multiple Tables with Sub-Queries

Solution
select * 
from employees 
where JOB_ID IN (select JOB_IDENT from jobs where JOB_TITLE= 'Jr. Designer');

Problem:
Retrieve JOB information and who earn more than $70,000.

Exercise 2: Accessing Multiple Tables with Implicit Joins

Problem:
Perform an implicit cartesian/cross join between EMPLOYEES and JOBS tables.
Solution
select * from employees, jobs;

Problem:
Retrieve only the EMPLOYEES records that correspond to jobs in the JOBS table.
Solution
select * from employees, jobs where employees.JOB_ID = jobs.JOB_IDENT;

Problem:
Redo the previous query, using shorter aliases for table names.
Solution
select * from employees E, jobs J where E.JOB_ID = J.JOB_IDENT;

Problem:
Redo the previous query, but retrieve only the Employee ID, Employee Name and Job Title.
Solution
select EMP_ID,F_NAME,L_NAME, JOB_TITLE from employees E, jobs J where E.JOB_ID = J.JOB_IDENT;

Problem:
Redo the previous query, but specify the fully qualified column names with aliases in the SELECT clause.
